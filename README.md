## Description
This is a repository for a note taking app. All app entries are stored onto a local server where they remain as objects within an array on a database file. When a note is taken an saved, a POST request is sent to the server that allows the note to be stored as an object. When the delete button is pressed, a DELETE request is made, which then splices the object based off of its ID property.
